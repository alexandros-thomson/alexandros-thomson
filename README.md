I’m Alexandros Thomson, architect of campaigns, builder of Discord realms, and orchestrator of monetized mythologies under Kypria-LLC.

## 🧠 What I'm About
- 🛡 Blending humor, gravitas, and recursion into digital storytelling
- ⚙️ Forging sponsor-driven lore engines and automated artifact drops
- 📜 Turning push cycles into canon, coin, and communal escalation

## 🌱 Actively Building
- ForgeBot escalation modules (webhook + payment flow logic)
- Mythic Sponsor Engine – delivering tiered lore in real time
- SISYPHUS Protocol – reframing grind as sacred recursion

## 🤝 Looking to Collaborate On
- Campaign drops, parody rituals, and digital product escalations
- Brand partnerships that feed the myth
- Discord server logic that fuels monetization and legend growth

✨ This repo is more than a portfolio. It’s where lore gets automated, sponsors are immortalized, and code becomes legend.
