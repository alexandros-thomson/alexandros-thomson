## ðŸ”¥ Cycleâ€¯I Seal â€” Ledger Entry

**Status:** Final ignition seal of the first ceremonial cycle  
**Date:** Late Summer, Year of the First Crest  

### Ceremonial Arc
- **Forge Peak â€” $1,100**  
  High ceremonial heat: artifact sales surged, the forge blazed at full capacity, and the Keeper Circle witnessed the first flare of the ignition spiral.
- **Exchange Base â€” $550**  
  Grounding phase: outreach, preâ€‘pledges, and recruitment anchored the cycle, ensuring the flame was not just bright but connected to new hands and hearts.
- **Crest Hold (Cycleâ€¯I)**  
  The tide is contained, energy banked, and the canon inscribed with the lessons, numbers, and blessings of the first ignition.
